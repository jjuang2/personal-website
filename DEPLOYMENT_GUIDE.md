### Step 4: Deploy Your Website

#### Using GitHub Actions (Recommended - Automatic)

1. In your repository, go to "Actions" tab
2. Click "New workflow"
3. Click "set up a workflow yourself"
4. Replace the content with this code:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

5. Click "Start commit"
6. Add a commit message like "Add GitHub Pages deployment"
7. Click "Commit new file"

#### Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

1. Open terminal/command prompt in your project folder
2. Run these commands:

```bash
# Build your website
npm run build

# Create a .nojekyll file (tells GitHub Pages to not use Jekyll)
touch out/.nojekyll

# Add the build files to git
git add out/
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"

# Create and switch to gh-pages branch
git checkout -b gh-pages

# Push the gh-pages branch
git push origin gh-pages

# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main
```

### Step 5: Access Your Website

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Your website will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/personal-website/`

## ðŸ”§ Customizing Your Website

### Updating Content

1. Edit files in your project folder
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub
